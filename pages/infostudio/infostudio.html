            <div class="story">
                <p>In 2020 the United States life expectancy drastically fell to a level not seen since the turn of the 21st century. This was due to a confluence of two factors: The COVID-19 pandemic and drug overdose deaths.</p>
                <p>Drug overdose deaths rose steadily from the mid 1990s to the early 2010s, but have been rising sharply since then, with a spike beginning in 2020 that has not yet ended.</p>

                <div class="statBlock">
                    <div class="stat">
                        <h4 style="color:#7899D4;">3.1</h4>
                        <p class="statInfo">overdose deaths per 100,000 people in 1996.</p>

                    <div class="stat">

                        <p class="statInfo">overdose deaths per 100,000 people in 2020.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="stat">
                        <h4>671%</h4>
                        <p class="statInfo">increase in overdose deaths from 1996 to 2020.</p>
                    </div>
                </div> 

                <p>The biggest reason for the sharp rise of opioid overdoses is the widespread marketing of the prescription opioid Oxycontin, which was released by Purdue Pharma in 1996. The pharmaceutical company released misleading studies about Oxycontin's drug dependency rate and sent out armies of salespeople to convince doctors to prescribe the drug. As time went on, Purdue released higher and higher dosage pills of Oxycontin in the interest of making more profit.</p>
                <p>Opioid prescriptions in the US peaked in 2012 at 96.3 precriptions per 100 people per year, which is almost one bottle of opioid pills for every single person in America. By this point, Perdue Pharma had already pled guilty to felony charges of misleading regulators about the addictiveness of the drug, but it was already too late. 2.1 million Americans were addicted to opioids before the prescription rate finally started to go down in 2013.</p>
                <p>However, not all areas of the US have been affected the same. Certain regions like the east coast have been devastated by the opioid epidemic, while areas of the midwest have been spared from the worst of it. Below is a graph of every county in the United States, showing that county's opioid dispensing rate vs. its drug overdose deaths.</p>

            <div class="story">
                <p>The dashed lines on this chart show the average number of prescriptions and overdose deaths across counties in America. This splits US counties up into four quadrants based on their relation to these averages&#8212; Less dispensing and less deaths on the bottom left, more dispensing and less deaths on the bottom right, less dispensing and more deaths on the top left, and more dispensing and more deaths on the top right. The averages for both axes are low on the overall range, showing that there is a high concentration on the lower values, but some outliers in the higher values. More detail on the different quadrants here:</p>

                <div class="keyItem">
                    <h3 style="color:#7899D4;">Less dispensing, less deaths</h3>
                    <p>These <b>868</b> counties avoided giving out too many opioid prescriptions and subsequently avoided copious overdose deaths. <b>4 out of every 10 rural counties</b> in the US have this designation. A possible explanation for this could be that small-town doctors were less targeted by opioid medication advertising.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="keyItem">
                    <h3 style="color: #917299">More dispensing, less deaths</h3>
                    <p>This is the rarest county designation at only <b>436</b> counties. Itâ€™s unclear why these counties managed to avoid overdose deaths given their high prescription rates, but <b>over half of these counties are rural</b>, meaning addicted persons may have moved to other counties where street drugs were more available, leading to less overdoses.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="keyItem">
                    <h3 style="color: #AA5064">Less dispensing, more deaths</h3>
                    <p>Over <b>half of the urban metros</b> in the US have this designation, and almost <b>a third of suburban metros</b>. These <b>521</b> counties did not prescribe many opioids, but street drugs are more widely available in these populous areas, and addicted persons from smaller counties may have migrated to these areas for more access to opioids.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="keyItem">
                    <h3 style="color: #DA1F2C">More dispensing, more deaths</h3>
                    <p>This is the most numerous county designation at <b>968</b> counties. Unfortunately, most counties in the US fell prey to the opioid epidemic. This quadrant has a multitude of all types of counties, including <b>over half of all medium metros</b> and <b>almost half of all small metros</b>. These areas were heavily targeted by pharmaceutical salesmen in the early 2000s.</p>

            <div class="story">
                <p>By taking these county designations and plotting them on a map, a regional picture starts to be revealed. Much of the eastern US has been hard-hit by the epidemic, with mostly red points, especially in the populated areas. The central portion of the country is much more blue, with many counties that didn't prescribe many opioids and also avoided overdose deaths. The western US is a mix, with some large cities that weren't badly affected, and some that were. There is not much visible representation of "more prescriptions and less deaths" counties, because those tend to have low populations, and therefore are not as visible on this map. However, if you look closely at the southeastern states, you will see that many of the smaller counties there have this designation.</p>

            <div class="story">
                <p>We still have not hit our peak in opioid deaths from this crisis, and it remains to be seen how long it will be from our peak dispensing rate. This is an epidemic that is slow, with ramifications years down the line. We must strive to treat those affected with compassion and work to lessen the effects of this epidemic, because they are victims of circumstance and a profit-hungry medical system.</p>

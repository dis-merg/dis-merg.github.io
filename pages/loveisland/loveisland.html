                    <h1>Who wins Love Island?</h1>
                    <p>In order to answer the question of “what kind of person is most likely to win Love Island?” I'm
                        using a data set I compiled about contestants on the show for seasons 1-8. Love Island is a
                        popular reality show where male and female contestants live in a villa together trying to find
                        love. Contestants are added and eliminated throughout the season, sometimes by the choice of the
                        other Islanders, the public, or the producers. The last 4 couples go to the finale where the
                        public votes for their favorite couple, awarding them $25k each. The variables I'm focusing on
                        in my dataset are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Name</li>
                            <li>Age</li>
                            <li>Gender</li>
                            <li>Race</li>
                            <li>Profession</li>
                            <li>Region of England</li>
                            <li>Outcome (winner, runner-up, dumped, etc.)</li>
                        </ul>
